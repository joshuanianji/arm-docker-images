# Docker x11 Bridge

JAremko's [docker-x11-bridge](https://github.com/JAremko/docker-x11-bridge) is used as a way to make Cypress run *inside* a devcontainer, while providing a GUI interface accessible outside the container.

It doens't have ARM support, but luckily, [there is a pr](https://github.com/JAremko/docker-x11-bridge/pull/13) I can use to build it myself. Hopefully it works!
